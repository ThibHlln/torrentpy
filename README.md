# TORRENTpy - An open-source tool for TranspORt thRough the catchmEnt NeTwork

TORRENTpy is an open-source framework for water, solutes, and particules transport through lumped and semi-distributed catchments in Python. It is licensed under GNU GPL-3.0 (see [licence file](LICENCE.md) provided). The framework simulates the hydrological fluxes using top-down catchment models that can be applied at the catchment scale or at the sub-catchment scale. Water quality models can complement the catchment models to simulate the water-borne transport of contaminants (both solutes and particles) at the scale where the catchment models are applied (i.e. catchment scale or sub-catchment scale).

## List of Models currently available in TORRENTpy

* Rainfall-Runoff Models:
	* `SMART` model (catchment runoff + river routing)

* Water Quality Models:
	* `INCA` model (catchment runoff + river routing)
