Example data files that can be used for this example are available in `examples/in/CatchmentSemiDistributedName_OutletName`. Files for a lumped situation are also provided in `examples/in/CatchmentLumpedName_OutletName`. At the end of this tutorial, the user will be able to check their output files against the output files provided in the out folder."

    "An instance of the `TimeFrame` class is also required. Be warned, the first four arguments need to be datetime.datetime objects from the package `datetime`. The arguments containing __data__ refer to the time information about the input data, the arguments containing __save__ refer to the desired time attributes of the output data, and the attributes containing __simu__ refer to the internal time information that will be used during simulation (typically the discretisation time step). Indeed, due to numerical instabilities, some models require an hourly simulation time step from daily input series. To overcome this potential problem, TORRENTpy can disaggregate the input series to the required simulation time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "A slicing of the save period is recommended to avoid memory issues during the simulation (when data structures become too big to be stored in the flash memory of the computer). Experience using TORRENTpy shows that a safe place where to start is 2000, which corresponds to 2000 simulation time steps. There is an optimum to be found between run time and memory limits, however because each catchment contains a different number of links, each simulation period length is different, and each user has access to different hardware specifications, no golden rule can be provided. Rather, the user is encouraged to try to increase this argument until a compromise is found for their own context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a warm-up period is possible with TORRENTpy: it uses the duration in days (let it be N) given and uses the first N days in the input data to warm up the model for the catchment, resulting in reservoirs not being empty when the actual simulation starts. If the user wishes to use real warm-up input data (that is to say actual past information on climate and contamination), it is recommended to include this warm-up period in the save period, and select *a posteriori* the save period excluding the warm-up period."

TORRENTpy can disaggregate input datasets if required, this is why for each type of data (meteorological and contamination) it is required to distinguish between __cumulative__ and __average__ data. If disaggregation is required (*i.e.* when simulation increment is smaller than data increment in the instance of `TimeFrame`): cumulative data will be disaggregated using a simple assumption of a uniform distribution in the past; average data will be disaggregate by replicating the values in the past."
