Description: # TORRENTpy - An open-source tool for TranspORt thRough the catchmEnt NeTwork
        
        TORRENTpy is an open-source framework for water, solutes, and particules transport through lumped and semi-distributed catchments in Python. It is licensed under GNU GPL-3.0 (see [licence file](LICENCE.md) provided). The framework simulates the hydrological fluxes using top-down catchment models that can be applied at the catchment scale or at the sub-catchment scale. Water quality models can complement the catchment models to simulate the water-borne contaminants (both solutes and particles) at the scale where the catchment models are applied (*i.e.* catchment scale or sub-catchment scale).
        
        ## List of Models currently available in TORRENTpy
        
        * Rainfall-Runoff Models:
        	* `SMART` model (catchment runoff + river routing)
        
        * Water Quality Models:
        	* `INCA` model (catchment runoff + river routing)
        
        ## Input/Output File Formats
        
        TORRENTpy is designed to read CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files and NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) files. However, the use of NetCDF files requires the Python package 'netCDF4' to be installed on the Python implementation where this package is installed.
